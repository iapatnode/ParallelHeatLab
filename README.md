# ParallelHeatLab

Capstone project for COMP 233, Parallel Computing.
This project simulated temperature fluctations on a grid containing thousands of temperatures and uses parallelization via implemententations of 
multi-thread, multi-processor, and hybrid solutions. A bash script for the automation of the multi-processor solutions was also created.
